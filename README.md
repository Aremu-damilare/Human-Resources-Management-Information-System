###The system is designed using a modular approach, with separate modules for managing employee information, benefits, and reports. The employee module allows HR staff to add, view, and update employee data, such as personal information, employment history, and performance reviews. The benefits module allows HR staff to manage employee benefits, such as health insurance, retirement plans, and vacation days. The report module allows HR staff to generate reports on employee data, such as headcount, turnover, and performance metrics.

The system is built using Django, which provides a robust and secure framework for web development. The system is also designed with responsive web design principles, ensuring that it is accessible and usable on a variety of devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

This repository contains the source code for the HRMIS web application. The system is deployed using Heroku, a cloud application platform.
